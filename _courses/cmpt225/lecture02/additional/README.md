> What is difference between ``public class`` and ``class``?

``class`` can't be imported outside of it's package, but ``public class`` can.


a code example can be found [here](src/main/java/example/App.java).

```bash
# build
mvn install

# run
java -jar target/example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Sample output:

```bash
1+1=2
1x1=1
```
