# practice7-solution - AVL trees

1. What is the minimal/maximal size of an  AVL tree of height 3 and height 4?

2. Draw the AVL tree obtained by inserting the sequence [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15].

3. Is this statement True or False? Justify your answer. "Every AVL tree with n vertices has height at most log(n)".

4. Is this statement True or False? Justify your answer. "Removal from an AVL tree always removes a leaf".

5. Insertion into an AVL tree always increases the number of leaves.

6. When a new element is added to an AVL tree as a leaf using the normal BST insertion, is it possible that more than one node becomes unbalanced?

7. Adding a new element to an AVL tree, we may require rebalancing at most one vertex.

8. If adding a vertex to an AVL tree requires a rebalancing of some nodes, then the height of the tree does not change.

9. When removing a node from an AVL tree, we may require rebalancing at most one vertex.

10. When removing a node from an AVL tree on n nodes, is it possible that O(log(n)) vertices need to be rebalanced?

11. When removing a node from an AVL tree on n nodes, is it possible that O(n) vertices need to be rebalanced?
